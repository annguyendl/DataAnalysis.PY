## Installing the Required Libraries

To build this app we need to install a few Python libraries. Please run the following commands in your terminal to install the correct library versions even if you have the libraries installed already:



Installing **justpy** (library for building web apps and data visualization):

```
pip3.9 install justpy==0.1.5
```



Installing **pandas** (library for data analysis):

```
pip3.9 install pandas==1.2.2
```



Installing **pytz** (library for datetime calculations between timezones)

```
pip3.9 install pytz==2021.1
```



Installing **matplotlib** (library for quick data visualization)

```
pip3.9 install matplotlib==3.3.4
```



Installing **jupyter** (library that enables a reach interactive Python shell)

```
pip3.9 install jupyter
```

**Note**: *The commands above assume you are using Python 3.9. If you are using another version of Python please change* `*pip3.9*` *to reflect the other version of Python you are using (e.g.,*`*pip3.8*`*).*



Starting Jupyter

We are going to use Jupyter in the next videos. Just to refresh your memory, Jupyter can be started by running the following command on your terminal:

```
jupyter notebook
```

That will start Jupyter Notebook on your internet browser.

If the above command doesn't work, try the alternative:

On Windows:

```
py -3.9 -m jupyter notebook
```

On Mac:

```
python3.9 -m jupyter notebook
```
